Must be used on 64-bit Windows.
Confirmed working on Windows 8 (should be working on everything below).
Does not work on Windows 10. Not just compatibility issues. 

How to use:
1) Run GIFXX.exe
2) Drag a GIF into the console window and hit enter. (Working for most of the GIFs in the folder)
3) Might have to wait a bit.
