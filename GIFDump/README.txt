Must be used on 64-bit Windows.
Confirmed working on Windows 8 (should be working on everything below, too).
Does not work on Windows 10. Not just compatibility issues. 

How to use:
1) Run GIFXX.exe (make sure GIFX.dll is in the same folder)
2) Drag a GIF into the console window and hit enter.
3) Might have to wait a bit.

The GIF decoder was manually written according to old specifications, so it's a bit slow, and it doesn't work for newer GIFs. 
Most of the GIFs here work though:
